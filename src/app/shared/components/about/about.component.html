          Hello, my name is Tom√°s and I'm a
          <span class="typing">Full Stack Developer</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          I started in the world of development when I began my technical degree
          at UTN two years ago and since then I am excited and motivated to know
          every day a little more, to have every day more tools.<br />
          I have had real work experience making websites as a Freelancer (where
          I have learned optimization, best practices, SEO and positioning
          according to Google) and experience in teams doing faculty projects
          and courses, which I do to deepen my knowledge. <br />
          I consider that as well as developing; communicating, listening and
          working in teams are skills that are trained daily and I love that. I
          am very happy to be part of the IT world and I look forward to
          collaborate with everything I learned this time and keep learning
          every day.
